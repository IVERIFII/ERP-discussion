# INTRODUCTION

This repository is used to gather, discuss and track ERP requirements only (including requests for new ERP requirements). Click [here](https://github.com/IVERIFII/ERP-requirements/issues) to open a new requirement request.

## Guidelines

ERPnext is an [open source ERP](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext) that we have decided to use as the ERP solution in Iverifii. However, it is still unsure if ERPnext is ready to fulfilled all our existing requirements or even unforeseen requirements in the future.

For this reason, we will first gather all our requirements and then discuss one by one whether ERPnext meets each of these requirements. For those requirements which ERPnext cannot fulfill, we will try to look for other workarounds before going further into the discussion on customization part. Once a requirement has been determined as can be fulfilled by ERPnext, the requirement will be closed and listed down below.

Requirement requests should be well specified and have unambiguous title.

Finally, there are four different tags to describe the progress of each requirement requests: **pending, discussing, customization-needed**.
